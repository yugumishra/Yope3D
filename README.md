# Yope3D
My Original Physics Engine made using LWJGL.

A 3D graphics engine capable of loading & displaying 3D models while also offering a scripting interface for easy game creation through the engine.

Built-in physics component with body system with customizable properties such as mass and inertia, rigid body interactions, spring-mass simulation (enabling soft body/cloth simulation). 

An acceleration structure (Binary Space Partioning Tree) allows the physics to be fast even at large numbers of bodies.

The engine includes raytracing capabilities (using OpenGL compute shaders), being able to draw shadows, recursively render reflections, and other optical phenomenon for quad form objects.
